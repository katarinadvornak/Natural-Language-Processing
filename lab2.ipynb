    "In this lab, we will explore different text representation models, such as Bag-of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF and word embeddings 🔤➡️🔢. Among these, word embeddings are the most effective in terms of performance. They represent each word as a vector of numbers, where each vector captures the meaning of the word 🧠📊.\n",

ConceptNet Numberbatch is part of the ConceptNet open data project. ConceptNet provides lots of ways to compute with word meanings, one of which is word embeddings. ConceptNet Numberbatch is a snapshot of just the word embeddings. It is built using an ensemble that combines data from ConceptNet, word2vec, GloVe, and OpenSubtitles 2016, using a variation on retrofitting.\",\n",

    "## 5. Sentence Embeddings by Averaging Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings are a powerful model for representing words and their meaning (in terms of distributional similarity). As we discussed in class, we can use them in a wide variety of tasks with more complex architectures. Word vectors offer a dense vector for each word. What if we wanted to represent a sentence (or a document) based on word vectors. How can we do that?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the course, we will see different architectures that take into account the sequence of words (by combining their vectors). A first naive but simple and sometimes (as we are going to see) quite effective approach would be to represent a sentence with an embedding vector that is the average of the word vectors that form the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "So formally, this is what we are aiming for:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\text{Sentence_Embedding} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\text{Word_Embedding}_i\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "* $N$ is the number of words in a sentence\n",
    "* $\\text{Word_Embedding}_i$ is the word vector for the $i$-th in the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to note:\n",
    "* The embedding vector for the sentence will obviously have the same dimension as the word embedding.\n",
    "* This representation ignores the word order (like bag-of-words). During the course we will see how we can overcome this limitation by using sequence models."
