## Maastricht University NLP Course Labs

This repository contains **four NLP labs** from the **Natural Language Processing course** at Maastricht University. The labs explore key NLP concepts, techniques, and applications.  

## Main Topics Covered
- Text preprocessing and representation (tokenization, stemming, vectors)
- Text classification and evaluation metrics
- Sequence labeling and named entity recognition (NER)
- Information extraction, language modeling, and text generation
- Modern NLP methods including neural networks, attention, and encoder models (BERT, seq2seq, LLMs)

> **Note:** Labs 1â€“3 include an accompanying **report** documenting methodology, results, and analysis.
