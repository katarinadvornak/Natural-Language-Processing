    "\n",
    "Tokenization is a fundamental step in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** 🧠💬 that transforms raw text into structured data for computational models. In this lab, you will explore different **tokenization techniques** 📝, preprocess text data 🔍, and implement **tokenization pipelines** using popular NLP libraries 🏗️.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You will also gain **hands-on experience** with **Hugging Face Datasets 🤗📚**, while assessing the impact of tokenization choices on downstream NLP tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will have a **strong foundation** in tokenization techniques and be able to apply them effectively in **real-world NLP applications** 🌍.  \n",

    "### 🎯 **Learning Goals**  \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you should be able to:  \n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Understand the role of tokenization in NLP** 🧠💡  \n",
    "✅ **Explain why tokenization is important** and how it affects text processing 📖🔍  \n",
    "✅ **Implement different tokenization techniques** – Apply **word** 📝, **subword** 🔢, and **character-level** 🔠 tokenization using built-in libraries.  \n",
    "✅ **Use Hugging Face Datasets** 🤗📊 – Load and preprocess text datasets efficiently.  \n",
    "✅ **Evaluate tokenization impact** 📉🔎 – Analyze how different tokenization methods influence model performance.  \n",
    "✅ **Identify challenges in tokenization** ❗🔍 – Recognize issues like **out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words**, **ambiguity**, and **multilingual tokenization** 🌍.  \n",
